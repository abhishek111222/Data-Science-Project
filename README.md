# Data-Science-Project

All the updates of the project. All the datasets to be stored here as well as the code.

1. Test of Time series for United States (June 4th): This folder contains the dataset from the kaggle as well as the code for the time series. The dataset is from January to March. The time series is calculated for United States as the maximum number of cases were from US that time. Check for other algorithms is still required. Also, try Deep AR forecasting algorithm.

2. Time series Mortality Rate week2 (June 6th): This work is still in progress, this is Sunday. This is for the plotting of Mortality Rate. I am confused here between daily_deaths/population or daily_deaths/confimed_cases. The population thing dont make sense to me as there is much difference between the other countries and one of the countries that I have which is India. India is the odd one here. Need to find a way to make all the dataset even. The dataset is started from May 1st to June. The last 42 rows are all NaN for the deaths, because the datasets is not updated on the website.

3. Time series of Mortality Rate (Try 3) (June 8th) [week2] : This task is also of week 2, this is Tuesday. This is of plotting of Martality Rate. I was being stupid, the task was just to do time series of different countries, not the comparison. So, the daily_deaths/population is correct. 
This is very useful link for Plotly : https://plotly.com/python/hover-text-and-formatting/  Here, at this moment Jan 10 (Thursday): need to figure out to make the lag plot in loop. Amswer is asked on Stack Overflow. The next thing is to figure out the auto correlation meaning and how to make that properly. Problem is the lag plot here. The data is very scattered. 
Date is June 11 : This file contains the ARIMA model for UK. The results are not satisfactory to me. Need to work more on this. 

4. week 3 : (June 15th) --> Until now this is the most important work done. This file contains the main data and the file in whoich we are making the dataset for our use. Till now, the UK dataset is close to done but need to figure out for all the countruies. Need to sort the issue with MOrtality rate an dthe fatality rate as well. The results that we got from here are from random forest but there may be some questions about the  dataset as the sopme of the features have a linear relatioinship and need to be eliminated. This is not checked but the formulas used gives mpost of the answer. ONe or the other thing needs to be eliminated. This need to to be done for all the countries and need to figiure out a better way for them to compare and a clean way as well. Multi-variant time series need to be kept in mind. 

5. week_5(July 1) --> This is not the complete work. ICU patients, reproduction rate and the mortality Rate is taken here. Last time did a very big mistake. Also need to take care of the the work time. The movies have to stop.

6. week5.ipynb : This is the week 5 work. The r2_score is in negartive -803, which is very bad. Need to find a solution to this thing. 
7. week6 : This is the work of the week6. Need to figure out the ways in which we can improve the cases. 

8. week8_1 : This is the work of week 8. The date is july 17th. I will like to check for the new variants and the vaccine given to the people. The vaccine has a very big role in the deaths as though the cases are increasing but still the number of deaths are reducing. This is because of the vaccine and needs to be considered. The lockdown also needs to be considered. 

9. week 9_1 : This is the week 9 starting work. Today is Monday and this is the starting where the Chapter 1 is about to start. This is mostly about Chapter 3 (Data report)
