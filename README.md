# Data-Science-Project

All the updates of the project. All the datasets to be stored here as well as the code.

1. Test of Time series for United States (June 4th): This folder contains the dataset from the kaggle as well as the code for the time series. The dataset is from January to March. The time series is calculated for United States as the maximum number of cases were from US that time. Check for other algorithms is still required. Also, try Deep AR forecasting algorithm.

2. Time series Mortality Rate week2 (June 6th): This work is still in process, this is Sunday. This is for the plotting of Mortality Rate. I am confused here between daily_deaths/population or daily_deaths/confimed_cases. The population thing dont make sense to me as there is much difference between the other countries and one of the countries that I have which is India. India is the odd one here. Need to find a way to make all the dataset even. The dataset is started from May 1st to June. The last 42 rows are all NaN for the deaths, because the datasets is not updated on the website.

3. Time series of Mortality Rate (Try 3) (June 8th) [week2] : This task is also of week 2, this is Tuesday. This is of plotting of Martality Rate. I was being stupid, the task was just to do time series of different countries, not the comparison. So, the daily_deaths/population is correct. 
This is very useful link for Plotly : https://plotly.com/python/hover-text-and-formatting/  Here, at this moment Jan 10 (Thursday): need to figure out to make the lag plot in loop. Amswer is asked on Stack Overflow. The next thing is to figure out the auto correlation meaning and how to make that properly. Problem is the lag plot here. The data is very scattered.
