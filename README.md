# Data-Science-Project

All the updates of the project. All the datasets to be stored here as well as the code.

1. Test of Time series for United States (June 4th): This folder contains the dataset from the kaggle as well as the code for the time series. The dataset is from January to March. The time series is calculated for United States as the maximum number of cases were from US that time. Check for other algorithms is still required. Also, try Deep AR forecasting algorithm.

2. time_series-week2 (June 6th): This work is still in process, this is Sunday. This is for the plotting of Mortality Rate. I am confused here between daily_deaths/population or daily_deaths/confimed_cases. The population thing dont make sense to me as there is much difference between the other countries and one of the countries that I have which is India.
